# keras-cifar
Scripts to train branching convolutional neural networks of different architectures (e.g., combining outputs of auxiliary heads in different ways) on CIFAR datasets.

These are toy examples of how you can efficiently automate training of different architectures in a programmatic way using Keras
and TensorFlow. Note the CIFAR-10 script can take days and the CIFAR-100 weeks to run through all of the architectures on an Amazon
EC2 p2.xlarge with an NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU.
